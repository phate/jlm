 * Interface for making alias analysis queries about pairs of pointers p1 and p2.

 * The analysis response gives guarantees about the possibility of [p1, p1+s1) and [p2, p2+s2)
 * overlapping.
 *
 * If p1 and p2 are local, they must both be defined in the same function.
 * When both pointers are defined within a region, the alias query is made relative to an
 * execution of that region. Thus, a NoAlias response does not make any guarantees about aliasing
