/**
 * An IOBarrier operation is used to sequentialize other operations after other IO state operations.
 * It has no equivalent in LLVM.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * int f(int x)
 * {
 *   opaque(); //calls internally exit(0)
 *   return x / 0;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The above code is valid C code and not undefined even though there is a division by zero present.
 * The reason for this is that the function opaque() invokes exit(0), and the division by zero is
 * never performed at runtime. In the RVSDG, the division operation has no dependency on the
 * function call to opaque() and therefore it can happen that it is sequentialized before the call
 * operation, transforming the valid program to an undefined program.
 *
 * The IOBarrier operation ensures a sequentialization of these two operations by routing one of the
 * division operands through it along with an I/O state as additional operand. The division
 * operation consumes then the result value of the IOBarrier operation, effectively seuqentializing
 * the division after the barrier and with that after the call operation:
 *
 * ... io = Call opaque ....
 * xo = IOBarrier x io
 * ... = ISDiv xo 0
