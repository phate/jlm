/**
 * Implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components in linear time.
 * Each node is assigned a strongly connected component (SCC), with SCC indices starting at 0.
 * SCC indices are assigned such that, for each edge A -> B in the original graph,
 * sccIndex[A] >= sccIndex[B]. They are equal iff A and B belong to the same SCC, i.e.
 * the original graph contains a path from A to B, and from B to A.
 *
 * In addition to assigning SCCs, a partial topological ordering of nodes is returned.
 * The ordering is a list of all nodes, sorted by descending SCC index.
 * Within a single SCC, the ordering of nodes is arbitrary.
 *
 * @tparam NodeType the integer type used to index nodes
 * @tparam SuccessorFunctor a functor with the signature (NodeType) -> iterable<NodeType>
 * @param numNodes the number of nodes. Nodes are indexed from 0 to numNodes-1
 * @param successors an instance of the SucessorFunctor
 * @param sccIndex output vector to be filled with the index of the SCC each node ends up in
 * @param topologicalOrder output vector to be filled with the nodes in a weak topological order
 * @return the number of SCCs in the graph. One more than the largest SCC index
