/**
 * Implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components in linear time.
 * Each node is assigned a strongly connected component (SCC), with SCC indices starting at 0.
 * SCC indices are assigned such that, for each edge A -> B in the original graph,
 * sccIndex[A] >= sccIndex[B]. They are equal iff A and B belong to the same SCC, i.e.
 * the original graph contains a path from A to B, and from B to A.
 *
 * In addition to assigning SCCs, a partial reverse topological ordering of nodes is returned.
 * The ordering is a list of all root nodes, ordered by non-descending SCC index.
 * Within a single SCC, the ordering of nodes is arbitrary.
 *
 * This function also supports graphs where nodes have been unified.
 * Within such a unification, one node is the root, while all other nodes are aliases for the root.
 * The given \p unificationRoot function should return the root for any node.
 * Only root nodes will be queried about their successors.
 * Nodes that are not roots will not be given an sccIndex, and not be included in topological order.
 *
 * @tparam NodeType the integer type used to index nodes
 * @tparam UnificationRootFunctor a functor with the signature (NodeType) -> NodeType
 * @tparam SuccessorFunctor a functor with the signature (NodeType) -> iterable<NodeType>
 * @param numNodes the total number of nodes, including non-root nodes in unifications.
 *        Nodes are indexed from 0 to numNodes-1
 * @param unificationRoot an instance of the UnificationRootFunctor
 * @param successors an instance of the SuccessorFunctor, returning outgoing edges from a root node.
 * @param sccIndex output vector to be filled with the index of the SCC each node ends up in.
 *        Only nodes that are roots will be given an sccIndex.
 * @param reverseTopologicalOrder output vector filled with root nodes in reverse topological order.
 *        In other words, a list of all root nodes, ordered with non-descending sccIndex.
 * @return the number of SCCs in the graph. One more than the largest SCC index
