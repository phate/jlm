/**
 * Implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components in linear time.
 * Each node is assigned an SCC, with scc indices starting at 0.
 * An SCC has a lower index than all its predecessor SCCs, and a larger index than its successors.
 *
 * In addition to assigning SCCs, a partial topological ordering of nodes is returned.
 * All nodes belonging to a given SCC are in a continuous subsequence.
 * All nodes belonging to predecessor SCCs come earlier in the list,
 * and all nodes belonging to successor SCCs come later.
 *
 * @tparam SuccessorFunctor a functor with the signature (size_t) -> iterable<size_t>
 * @param numNodes the number of nodes. Nodes are indexed from 0 to numNodes-1
 * @param successors an instance of the SucessorFunctor
 * @param sccIndex output vector to be filled with the index of the SCC each node ends up in
 * @param topologicalOrder output vector to be filled with the nodes in a weak topological order
 * @return the number of SCCs in the graph. One more than the largest SCC index
