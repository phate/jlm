# JLM: A research compiler based on the RVSDG IR

Jlm is an experimental compiler/optimizer that consumes and produces LLVM IR. It uses the
Regionalized Value State Dependence Graph (RVSDG) as intermediate representation for optimizations.

## Dependencies
* Clang/LLVM 18
* Doxygen 1.9.1
* `lit` 18

### HLS dependencies
* MLIR 18
* CIRCT that is built with LLVM/MLIR 18
* Verilator 4.038

### MLIR backend and frontend dependencies
* MLIR 18

### Optional dependencies
* gcovr, for computing code coverage summary

## Bootstrap
```
./configure.sh
make all
```

This presumes that the right version of llvm-config can be found in $PATH.
If that is not the case, you may need to explicitly configure it:

```
./configure.sh --llvm-config /path/to/llvm-config
make all
```

For working on the code, it is advisable to initialize header file
dependency tracking to ensure that dependent objects get recompiled when
header files are changed:

```
make depend
```

Additional information about supported build options is available via
`./configure.sh --help`. Useful options include specifying
`--target debug` to switch to a debug build target instead of the (default)
release target.

## Documentation
Invoke the following command to generate the doxygen documentation:
```
make docs
```
The documentation can then be found at `docs/html/index.html`

## Tests
To run unit tests and jlc C compilation tests, execute
```
make check
```

The tests can also be run instrumented under valgrind to validate absence
of detectable memory errors:
```
make valgrind-check
```

Lastly, when the build has been configured with coverage support (specifying
`--enable-coverage` configure flag for the build), then following build target
will compute unit test coverage for all files:
```
make coverage
```
The report will be available in build/coverage/coverage.html.

To ensure that all build information in the makefiles are correct, it is also
advisable to check that all headers used are declared (this is quite easy
to forget). To do this, you can run:
```
make check-headers
```

## High-level synthesis (HLS) backend
The HLS backend uses the MLIR FIRRTL dialect from CIRCT to convert llvm IR to FIRRTL code.

A compatible installation of CIRCT is needed to compile jlm with the capability to generate FIRRTL
and the build has to be configured accordingly. A change of build configuration may require cleaning
stale intermediate files first, i.e., run 'make clean'.
CIRCT and the HLS backend can be setup with the following commands:
```
./scripts/build-circt.sh

./configure --enable-hls
```

## MLIR backend
The MLIR backend uses the MLIR RVSDG dialect.

A compatible installation of the MLIR RVSDG dialect is needed to compile jlm with the MLIR backend
enabled, and the build has to be configured accordingly. A change of build configuration may require
cleaning stale intermediate files first, i.e., run 'make clean'.
The MLIR RVSDG dialect and the MLIR backend can be setup with the following commands:
```
./scripts/build-mlir.sh

./configure --enable-mlir
```
