# JLM: A research compiler based on the RVSDG IR
[![Tests](https://github.com/phate/jlm/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phate/jlm/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Jlm is an experimental compiler/optimizer that consumes and produces LLVM IR. It uses the
Regionalized Value State Dependence Graph (RVSDG) as intermediate representation for optimizations.

## Dependencies
* Clang/LLVM 16
* Doxygen 1.9.1

### HLS dependencies
* CIRCT
* Verilator 4.038

## Bootstrap
```
export LLVMCONFIG=<path-to-llvm-config>
make all
```
Please ensure that `LLVMCONFIG` is set to the correct version of `llvm-config` as stated in
dependencies.

## Documentation
Invoke the following command to generate the doxygen documentation:
```
make docs
```
The documentation can then be found at `docs/html/index.html`


## High-level synthesis (HLS) backend
The HLS backend uses the MLIR FIRRTL dialect from CIRCT to convert llvm IR to FIRRTL code.

A compatible installation of CIRCT is needed to compile jlm with the capability to generate FIRRTL code and the CIRCT_PATH and LLVMCONFIG environment variables have to be set. If jlm has been built without the CIRCT_PATH being set then it needs to be rebuilt to enable FIRRTL generation, i.e., run 'make clean release'.
```
export CIRCT_PATH=<path-to-CIRCT-installation>
export LLVMCOFNIG=$CIRCT_PATH/bin/llvm-config
```

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH might also need to include CIRCT_LIB for the CIRCT tools to work.

### Manual CIRCT setup
Start by cloning the CIRCT git repository and checkout the compatible commit.
```
git clone git@github.com:circt/circt.git
cd circt
git checkout a0e883136331c4a05ac366d5b31962a9de8d803b
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then follow the instructions on "Setting this up" in circt/README.md, but skip 2) as it has already been performed with the above commands.

### Automated CIRCT setup
An automated CIRCT setup is provided by the jlm-eval-suite through the following commands:
```
git clone  git//github.com:phate/jlm-eval-suite.git
cd jlm-eval-suite
make submodule-circt
make circt-build
```

This will build llvm, mlir, and circt for you and install it in jlm-eval-suite/circt/local. The build of llvm requires at least 16 GiB of main memory (RAM), as well as ninja and cmake to be installed.
A complete list of dependencies can be found in the [getting started instrutions for LLVM/MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/).

Not that the jlm-eval-suite has the jlm compiler as a submodule. To compile jlm with the newly installed CIRCT setup (assuming you are still in jlm-eval-suite):
```
make submodule
make jlm-release -j `nproc`
make jlm-check -j `nproc`
```

The jlm-eval-suite comes with a suite of HLS tests. The verilator simulator has to be installed To be able to run these. If the hls-test-suite is run using the provided make targets, e.g., 'make hls-test-run', then there is no need to set any of the environment variables mentioned above.
