/** \brief Memory State Encoder Interface
 *
 * A memory state encoder encodes a points-to graph in the RVSDG. The basic idea is that there exists a one-to-one
 * correspondence between memory nodes in the points-to graph and memory states in the RVSDG, i.e., for each memory
 * node in the points-to graph, there exists a memory state edge in the RVSDG. A memory state encoder routes these
 * state edges through the RVSDG's structural nodes and ensures that simple nodes operating on a
 * memory location represented by a corresponding memory node in the points-to graph are sequentialized with the
 * respective memory state edge. For example, a store node that modifies a global variable needs to have the respective
 * state edge that corresponds to its memory location routed through it, i.e., the store node
 * is sequentialized by this state edge. Such an encoding ensures that the ordering of side-effecting operations
 * touching on the same memory locations is preserved, while rendering operations independent that are not operating on
 * the same memory locations.
